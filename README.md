# Note:

For the best experience, view the prototype on full screen. (Expand the presentation using the arrows in the top right of the screen.)

Due to some of the  limitations in Figma, we took the following considerations into account to reduce the complications:

1. We wanted the splash screen to automatically transition to the beginning of the application. Since there was no option in Figma to do the same, we decided to have an “On Tap” interaction, mentioned by the “Click to Continue...” message.
2. In the filter section of the recipe selection, only one Dropdown filter (Cuisine menu) recipe is elaborated. 
3. After scanning the ingredients in task1,  the option to remove the ingredients by clicking on the X icon is clickable only for the “flour” ingredient.
4. There is only one available interactive path(clickable elements are limited) for search and filter features.
5. The search keywords are restricted (like “Pie” in the search recipe, “flour” in Add Ingredients while scanning the ingredients for searching the recipe, etc) for reducing the complexity of typing 
6. The mechanism to correct the mistakes/undo the actions is restricted to only a few actions (for clearing the filter, for leaving the session, etc). 
7. There was no option to show a temporary Toast message in Figma as in mobile phones. So, the user needs to click on the message to hide it. 
8. Clicking on the closed state of the drop-down can lead to an unstable state which is not expected from the actual UI
9. After ending the Live Learning session, the rating dialog pops up. Clicking on the ratings leads to a 5 star-rating. This is kept constant for now to reduce the complexity, but ideally, all intermediate ratings are possible for the application.
